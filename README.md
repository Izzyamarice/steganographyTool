# Steganography tool

This tool will allow users to supply a picture they would like to use and a message they would like to insert too. It will then produce a new file in the same directory with the message inserted.

Alternatively, the user can supply a picture that already has a message inside and the tool will provide the user with the message.


# Currently to do:
- Need to create a stylesheet for the gui - text and the elements
- Need to create/edit the python logic
- Need to make the loaded images resize in the application
- Need to link the python with the gui - add actions for the gui elements
- Need to link the python with the gui - add methods to correlate with the actions
- Need to set the current print statements in the stegoExecution and main file to be gui alerts rather than print statements
- Need a popup/alert that says image has been created when we encode it
