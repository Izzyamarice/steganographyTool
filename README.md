# Steganography tool

This tool will allow users to supply a picture they would like to use and a message they would like to insert too. It will then produce a new file in the same directory with the message inserted.

Alternatively, the user can supply a picture that already has a message inside and the tool will provide the user with the message.


# Currently to do:
- Need to set the current print statements in the stegoExecution and main file to be gui alerts rather than print statements
- Need a popup/alert that says image has been created when we encode it
- Need to make sure it can handle creating a new file when the file name already exists

# The images below represent the application's current state
